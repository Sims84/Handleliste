You still have that git rebase blocking you! Let's fix it so you can sync properly: ## ðŸ”§ **Fix the Git Rebase Issue:** ### **Quick Solution - Abort the Rebase:** 1. **Open the Shell** at the bottom of your Replit workspace 2. **Copy and paste this command** and press Enter: ```bash git rebase --abort ``` 3. You should see a message confirming the rebase was aborted ### **Then Sync Your Changes:** After aborting the rebase, run these commands in order: ```bash git add . git commit -m "Updated authentication and resolved conflicts" git pull origin main --no-rebase ``` If you get conflicts again (like with vite.config.js), let me know which files and I'll help resolve them. --- ### **Alternative: Use Replit's Git Panel** If the Shell commands don't work: 1. Open **Version Control** panel on the left sidebar 2. Look for an option to **"Abort rebase"** or **"Cancel operation"** 3. Then use the Pull/Sync button --- **Once the rebase is aborted, you'll be able to sync normally!** Let me know what happens when you run `git rebase --abort`.
How do i know witch files that need reolsving before syncing
